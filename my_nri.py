# Andre: This code is based on my own approach/way of computing NRI, for which there is
# a proof of equivalence.  It uses confusion matrices for the reference and new
# models.  It does not need to track each instance individually.  It also, therefore
# does not have to have the labels and scores in the same order, as an advantage.
# Furthermore, it has other, potential uses as a generalization of NRI.
